## Homework exercises for Week #2 - Variables, Methods and Lists

### 1. Word Frequency Count
Write a `GET` endpoint that takes a `string` as input and counts the frequency of each word in the `string`. 
Your program should output a list of `objects` where each `object` contains a word and its frequency. 
For example, if the input string is "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", your program should output the following list:
`[("the", 2), ("quick", 1), ("brown", 1), ("fox", 1), ("jumps", 1), ("over", 1), ("lazy", 1), ("dog", 1)]`
